# CHANGELOG

## v2.0.0 | 5 May 2025

`dyco` uses eddy covariance raw data files as input and produces lag-compensated raw data files as output.

Version `2.0.0` changes the previous workflow.

`dyco` identifies and corrects time lags between variables. It iteratively searches for lags between two variables,
e.g., `W` (turbulent vertical wind) and `S` (scalar used for time lag detection, e.g. CO<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub>),
starting with a broad time window and progressively narrowing it based on the distribution of found lags. This iterative
refinement helps pinpoint consistent lags, suggesting strong covariance. Lag searches can be performed on short segments
of a long file. After collecting all identified lags, `dyco` filters outliers and creates a look-up table of daily time
lags. This table is then used to shift variables in the input files, correcting for the identified lags. While `S` is
typically used for lag detection, the correction can be applied to other variables as needed. Lags are expressed in "
number of records"; the corresponding time depends on the data's recording frequency.

This update also implements [diive](https://github.com/holukas/diive) as a required dependency. The advantage of this
implementation is that existing (and better tested) code in `diive` does not have to be duplicated for `dyco`
(although the copy-paste approach has its merits), the drawback is that yes there is another dependency. I will try
not to break things.

For a more detailed explanation of the `dyco` processing chain please see the [README](README.md).

### Changes

- The minimum time window for lag search is now min. 20 records, which corresponds to +/- 0.5s for 20 Hz
  data. If the automatically detected window is smaller than 20 records it is automatically expanded.
  For example:
    - if the lag is searched between -8 and -3 records: `[-8, -3]` is expanded incrementally until the range between
      the two values is >= 20, `[-16, 5]`. Since the increase is always done on both sides of the search window,
      the resulting range in this example is 21 records.
    - Another example: `[-5, 5]` is expanded to `[-10, 10]`
      (`lag.AdjustLagsearchWindow.adjust_lgs_winsize`)
- When creating the look-up table for daily median lags, missing median values are now filled with the
  rolling median in a 5-day window, centered around the missing value. (`analyze.AnalyzeLags.make_lut_agg`)
- Added `diive` library to dependencies
- Several functions are now handled
  by `diive`: `calc_true_resolution`, `create_timestamp`, `search_files`, `FileDetector`, `MaxCovariance`
- Plots are now explicitely closed after export to avoid memory issues
- Parquet files can now be used for data input. If found files have the extension `.parquet`, the correct function to
  read the file is used.
