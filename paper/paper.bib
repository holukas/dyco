Most studies of material exchange reported in the ecological literature have relied on chamber techniques. Micrometeorological techniques provide an alternative means of measuring these exchange rates and are expected to be used more often in future ecological studies, since they have many advantages over the chamber techniques. In this article we will provide an overview of micrometeorological theory and the different micrometeorological techniques available to make flux measurements.

	abstract = {Abstract. All eddy-covariance flux measurements are associated with random uncertainties which are a combination of sampling error due to natural variability in turbulence and sensor noise. The former is the principal error for systems where the signal-to-noise ratio of the analyser is high, as is usually the case when measuring fluxes of heat, CO2 or H2O. Where signal is limited, which is often the case for measurements of other trace gases and aerosols, instrument uncertainties dominate. Here, we are applying a consistent approach based on auto- and cross-covariance functions to quantify the total random flux error and the random error due to instrument noise separately. As with previous approaches, the random error quantification assumes that the time lag between wind and concentration measurement is known. However, if combined with commonly used automated methods that identify the individual time lag by looking for the maximum in the cross-covariance function of the two entities, analyser noise additionally leads to a systematic bias in the fluxes. Combining data sets from several analysers and using simulations, we show that the method of time-lag determination becomes increasingly important as the magnitude of the instrument error approaches that of the sampling error. The flux bias can be particularly significant for disjunct data, whereas using a prescribed time lag eliminates these effects (provided the time lag does not fluctuate unduly over time). We also demonstrate that when sampling at higher elevations, where low frequency turbulence dominates and covariance peaks are broader, both the probability and magnitude of bias are magnified. We show that the statistical significance of noisy flux data can be increased (limit of detection can be decreased) by appropriate averaging of individual fluxes, but only if systematic biases are avoided by using a prescribed time lag. Finally, we make recommendations for the analysis and reporting of data with low signal-to-noise and their associated errors.},

	abstract = {An eddy covariance system is described which has been developed jointly at a number of European laboratories and which was used widely in HAPEX-Sahel. The system uses commercially available instrumentation: a three-axis sonic anemometer and an IR gas analyser which is used in a closed-path mode, i.e. air is brought to the optical bench by being ducted down a sampling tube from a point near the sonic anemometer. The system is controlled by specially written software which calculates the surface fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide, and displays them in real time. The raw turbulent records can be stored for post-processing. Up to five additional analogue instruments can be sampled at up to 10 Hz and digitised by the sonic anemometer. The instruments are described and details of their operation and connection are presented. The system has relatively low power consumption and can operate from appropriate solar cells or rechargeable batteries. Calibration of the gas analyser needs to be performed typically every 2 or 3 days, and, given that the system requires minimal maintenanceand is weather insensitive,it can be operated for the routine collection of surface flux data for extended periods. There are a number of corrections which have to be applied in any eddy covariance system and we describe the system of transfer functions which define our system. Some representative results showing the potential of the system are presented.},

	abstract = {The ﬁrst full greenhouse gas (GHG) ﬂux budget of an intensively managed grassland in Switzerland (Chamau) is presented. The three major trace gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. For CO2 concentrations, an open-path infrared gas analyzer was used, while N2O and CH4 concentrations were measured with a recently developed continuous-wave quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer (QCLAS). We investigated the magnitude of these trace gas emissions after grassland restoration, including ploughing, harrowing, sowing, and fertilization with inorganic and organic fertilizers in 2012. Large peaks of N2O ﬂuxes (20–50 nmol mÀ2 sÀ1 compared with a {\textless}5 nmol mÀ2 sÀ1 background) were observed during thawing of the soil after the winter period and after mineral fertilizer application followed by re-sowing in the beginning of the summer season. Nitrous oxide (N2O) ﬂuxes were controlled by nitrogen input, plant productivity, soil water content and temperature. Management activities led to increased variations of N2O ﬂuxes up to 14 days after the management event as compared with background ﬂuxes measured during periods without management ({\textless}5 nmol mÀ2 sÀ1). Fluxes of CO2 remained small until full plant development in early summer 2012. In contrast, methane emissions showed only minor variations over time. The annual GHG ﬂux budget was dominated by N2O (48\% contribution) and CO2 emissions (44\%). CH4 ﬂux contribution to the annual budget was only minor (8\%). We conclude that recently developed multi-species QCLAS in an EC system open new opportunities to determine the temporal variation of N2O and CH4 ﬂuxes, which further allow to quantify annual emissions. With respect to grassland restoration, our study emphasizes the key role of N2O and CO2 losses after ploughing, changing a permanent grassland from a carbon sink to a signiﬁcant carbon source.},

	abstract = {Central European grasslands are characterized by a wide range of different management practices in close geographical proximity. Site-specific management strategies strongly affect the biosphere–atmosphere exchange of the three greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). The evaluation of environmental impacts at site level is challenging, because most in situ measurements focus on the quantification of CO2 exchange, while long-term N2O and CH4 flux measurements at ecosystem scale remain scarce. Here, we synthesized ecosystem CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes from 14 managed grassland sites, quantified by eddy covariance or chamber techniques. We found that grasslands were on average a CO2 sink (À1,783 to À91 g CO2 mÀ2 yearÀ1), but a N2O source (18–638 g CO2-eq. mÀ2 yearÀ1), and either a CH4 sink or source (À9 to 488 g CO2eq. mÀ2 yearÀ1). The net GHG balance (NGB) of nine sites where measurements of all three GHGs were available was found between À2,761 and À58 g CO2eq. mÀ2 yearÀ1, with N2O and CH4 emissions offsetting concurrent CO2 uptake by on average 21 Æ 6\% across sites. The only positive NGB was found for one site during a restoration year with ploughing. The predictive power of soil parameters for N2O and CH4 fluxes was generally low and varied considerably within years. However, after site-specific data normalization, we identified environmental conditions that indicated enhanced GHG source/sink activity (“sweet spots”) and gave a good prediction of normalized overall fluxes across sites. The application of animal slurry to grasslands increased N2O and CH4 emissions. The N2O-N emission factor across sites was 1.8 Æ 0.5\%, but varied considerably at site level among the years (0.1\%–8.6\%). Although grassland management led to increased N2O and CH4 emissions, the CO2 sink strength was generally the most dominant component of the annual GHG budget.},
